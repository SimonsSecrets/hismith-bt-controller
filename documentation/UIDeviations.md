# UI Deviations — WPF vs. Design

A definitive checklist of every place the current WPF app diverges from the design files in
`design/` (`index.html` CSS + `app.jsx` / `connection.jsx` / `modes.jsx`). The goal is to drive
the WPF UI to a pixel-faithful match of the design, except where the user has explicitly chosen to
deviate.

**How to read this:** each item notes the design intent, the current WPF state, and the concrete
fix. Severity is a rough triage aid:
- 🔴 **Major** — whole component/screen missing or structurally wrong.
- 🟡 **Moderate** — present but visibly off (wrong shape, color, gradient, layout).
- 🟢 **Minor** — small numeric/polish gap, easy to miss.

Source of truth for colors/sizes: `design/index.html` `:root` tokens and the per-component CSS.

Issues that the user does not want to fix are marked with [SKIP]

> **Revision note:** re-synced against the updated design files. The latest design adds a full
> **Settings screen** (§13), turns the mode-bar's left button into a **Settings gear** (§6.3), adds a
> **Settings gear on the connection screens** (§5.6), and makes the theme a **Light/Dark/System**
> choice that lives in Settings (§12.1). The Settings screen, the mode-bar gear (§6.3), and the theme
> relocation (§12.1) are **tracked as one consolidated item under §13.1**. `modes.jsx` and
> `connection.jsx` are otherwise unchanged.

## 1. Window chrome & shell

### 1.1 🔴 [SKIP] No custom title bar
- **Design** (`app.jsx` `.titlebar`, `index.html:180`): a 44 px custom title bar (`--titlebar` `#F7ECE7`)
  containing a gradient app-logo square (18 px, rose→`#E0A07F`→gold), the "HismithController" label
  (13 px, weight 600), and three custom window buttons (minimize / maximize / close) with the close
  button turning `#E81123` red on hover.
- **WPF** (`MainWindow.xaml`): a plain `<Window>` using the default OS title bar. No custom chrome,
  no gradient logo, no styled window buttons.
- **Fix:** add `WindowChrome` (or `WindowStyle="None"` + custom bar) reproducing the design title bar.
  The `TitlebarBrush` token already exists in the theme but is unused.

### 1.2 🟡 [SKIP] Window is resizable / wrong rounding
- **Design**: fixed 540×960 portrait "window" with 12 px rounded corners and a soft outer drop shadow
  (`--shadow-window`).
- **WPF** (`MainWindow.xaml:10-11`): `Height=960 Width=540` but `MinHeight=640 MinWidth=480`, freely
  resizable, square OS corners, no app-level shadow.
- **Fix:** decide whether the app stays fixed-size like the mock or remains resizable; if matching the
  design, add rounded corners + drop shadow and lock/limit resize.

---

## 2. First-run welcome overlay

### 2.1 ✅ Welcome overlay — IMPLEMENTED
- **Design** (`app.jsx` `Welcome`, `index.html:844` `.welcome`): a modal overlay with blurred backdrop,
  gradient logo tile, "HismithController" heading, tagline "Explore, experiment, enjoy", three numbered
  step cards (Connect / Choose a mode / Play), and a single "Get started" button.
  *(Updated design: tagline changed from "Move to the beat." and the "Skip" button was removed.)*
- **Done** (`UI/Views/WelcomeView.xaml`): full-window scrim (`OverlayBackBrush` token) + centred card
  (gradient logo, heading, tagline, three step cards, "Get started" with a soft rose glow), mounted
  last in `MainWindow.xaml` so it paints over everything. The content layers behind it are blurred
  via a `BlurEffect` (design's `backdrop-filter: blur`), keyed off `IsWelcomeOpen`. Gated on
  `MainViewModel.IsWelcomeOpen`, seeded from the persisted `UserPreferences.HasSeenWelcome` first-run
  flag; "Get started" runs `DismissWelcomeCommand`, which hides the overlay and saves the flag
  (`user-settings.json`) so it never reappears.

---

## 3. Lost-connection banner

### 3.1 🔴 Connected-state lost banner not implemented
- **Design** (`app.jsx` `LostBanner`, `index.html:500` `.banner`): a coral banner shown **above the
  content while connected** — warning icon, "Connection lost" / "Your device has stopped. Your settings
  are preserved.", with Dismiss + Reconnect buttons.
- **WPF** (`ConnectedView.xaml`): no banner region. (The "lost" handling that exists is only the status
  chip's `Lost` dot color; the full banner is absent.)
- **Fix:** add the banner to `ConnectedView` above the mode content, driven by a "connection lost" state.

---

## 4. Toast notifications

### 4.1 🟢 [SKIP] Toast not implemented
- **Design** (`app.jsx` `toast`, `index.html:870` `.toast`): a pill toast at the bottom center (e.g.
  "Would open Windows Settings") with a Dismiss action.
- **WPF**: not implemented. Low priority — only used by the `failAdapter` path in the mock.

---

## 5. Connection screens (`ConnectionView.xaml`)

### 5.1 🔴 Missing "Bluetooth unavailable" (no-adapter) screen
- **Design** (`app.jsx` `failAdapter`): a FailCard titled "Bluetooth unavailable" with "Open Settings".
- **WPF**: `ConnectionPhase` enum has `PreConnect, Scanning, DevicesFound, NoDevicesFound, Connecting,
  ConnectionFailed, IncompatibleDevice` — no no-adapter phase/screen.
- **Fix:** add the phase + a FailCard variant (reuse the coral warning illustration).

### 5.2 🟡 Selected device icon disappears (icon box "all pink")
- **Design** (`connection.jsx` `.device.selected .icon`): on selection the icon box fills rose and the
  Bluetooth glyph turns **white**.
- **WPF** (`ConnectionView.xaml:96-103`): the selection `DataTrigger` sets `IconBox.Background` and
  `BorderBrush` to rose but **never changes the inner `Path` stroke** (stays `RoseBrush`), so the glyph
  is invisible against the rose fill.
- **Fix:** add a setter changing the icon `Path` stroke to white when selected.
  *(Tracked in `OpenTasks.md`.)*

### 5.3 🟡 Connecting stepper has no "done / green" state
- **Design** (`connection.jsx` `ConnectingCard`, `.step.done`): each step goes inactive → **active (rose)**
  → **done (sage/green with a check icon)**.
- **WPF** (`ConnectionView.xaml:396-487`): steps only toggle inactive ↔ active (rose). No completed/green
  state and no check glyph.
- **Fix:** add a "done" visual (sage circle + check) keyed off `ConnectStep`.
  *(Tracked in `OpenTasks.md`.)*

### 5.4 🟢 Spinner style differs
- **Design** (`.spinner`): a smooth ring, `rose-soft` track with a solid rose top arc, spinning.
- **WPF** (`ConnectionView.xaml:364-385`): a **dashed** ellipse (`StrokeDashArray 4,6`) rotating — reads
  as dashes, not a clean arc-with-track.
- **Fix:** template the spinner as a full track ring + a rose arc overlay.

### 5.5 🟢 [SKIP] Card width
- **Design**: `.connect-card` `max-width: 520px` (content cap 480).
- **WPF** (`ConnectionView.xaml:116`): hard `Width=480 MaxWidth=480`.
- **Fix:** confirm intended max width (likely fine, but the design card is up to 520).

### 5.6 ✅ Settings gear on connection screens — IMPLEMENTED
- **Design** (`app.jsx` `.settings-fab`, `index.html:944`): a 38 px round gear button pinned top-right
  (`top:18 right:18`) inside the card frame on the pre-connect, devices-found, empty, and fail screens
  (hidden during scanning/connecting). Opens the Settings screen (§13).
- **Done** (`ConnectionView.xaml`): top-right 38 px gear FAB added as the last child of the centred
  card frame, hidden via `Phase` DataTriggers during Scanning/Connecting, wired to the window-level
  `OpenSettingsCommand`. (Done together with §13.1.)

---

## 6. Mode bar (`ConnectedView.xaml`)

### 6.1 🟡 Mode tabs have no icons
- **Design** (`app.jsx` `ModeStrip`): Manual tab has a gear/settings icon, Sound tab has a music-note
  icon (13 px, before the label).
- **WPF** (`ConnectedView.xaml:148-157`): text-only "Manual" / "Sound" tabs.
- **Fix:** add the leading icons.
  *(Tracked in `OpenTasks.md` as "Mode navigation icons".)*

### 6.2 🟡 [SKIP] Missing disabled "+" (more modes) tab
- **Design** (`app.jsx` `ModeStrip`): a third disabled tab with a "+" icon, tooltip "More modes coming
  soon".
- **WPF**: only two tabs; no "+" placeholder.
- **Fix:** add a disabled third tab with a plus glyph.

### 6.3 ✅ Mode-bar left button is now a Settings gear — IMPLEMENTED
- The design's mode-bar left slot is now a **Settings gear** (not a theme toggle), and theme switching
  has moved into the Settings screen. **Done as part of §13.1 (part B):** `ConnectedView.xaml`'s left
  slot is a gear bound to `OpenSettingsCommand`; the old sun/moon `ToggleThemeCommand` button is gone.

---

## 7. Sound mode visualizer (`SoundModeView.xaml`)

### 7.1 🔴 [SKIP] Missing "Listening to system audio" pill
- **Design** (`modes.jsx` `.viz-listening`): a top-left pill with a blinking live-dot and the text
  "Listening to system audio" (or "No audio"), on a translucent blurred background.
- **WPF** (`SoundModeView.xaml`): no such pill. (The `SoundModeViewModel` even references a "live-dot
  DataTrigger in the view" at line ~98, but no element consumes it.)
- **Fix:** add the top-left listening pill + blinking/beat live-dot.

### 7.2 🟡 Visualizer height too short
- **Design** (`.visualizer.compact`): 140 px tall.
- **WPF** (`SoundModeView.xaml:31`): `Height=90`.
- **Fix:** set the visualizer height to 140.

### 7.3 🟡 Visualizer has no background gradient
- **Design** (`.visualizer`): vertical gradient `--viz-bg-top` (`#FBEFF3`) → `--viz-bg-bot` (`#FFF7F0`).
- **WPF** (`SoundModeView.xaml:32`): solid `SurfaceSoftBrush`.
- **Fix:** use a `LinearGradientBrush` with the two viz tokens (add them to the theme).

### 7.4 🟡 Visualizer corner radius
- **Design**: 14 px.
- **WPF** (`SoundModeView.xaml:31`): `CornerRadius=8`.
- **Fix:** set to 14 (also update the idle-overlay/clip to match).

### 7.5 🟡 Spectrum bars: solid color, wrong corner radius
- **Design** (`.viz-bars i`): each bar is a vertical gradient rose→`#E0A07F`, `border-radius: 6px`.
- **WPF** (`SoundModeView.xaml:85-89`): solid `RoseBrush`, `CornerRadius=1.5`.
- **Fix:** apply the bar gradient and a ~6 px corner radius (scaled to bar width).

### 7.6 🟡 Beat indicator is the wrong shape
- **Design** (`modes.jsx` sound mode uses `.viz-beat-ring`): the beat pulse is a **rounded-rectangle
  border flashing around the entire visualizer** (`inset:0`, 2 px rose, 14 px radius), fading out.
- **WPF** (`SoundModeView.xaml:99-112`): a small **68 px circle** (`Ellipse`) centered in the visualizer.
- **Fix:** replace the centered ellipse with a full-bleed rounded-rect border overlay that flashes on
  each beat.

### 7.7 🟢 Idle overlay missing the bobbing dots
- **Design** (`.viz-idle .idle-rings`): three rose bobbing dots above "Play some music to get started".
- **WPF** (`SoundModeView.xaml:151-169`): only the text label, no animated dots.
- **Fix:** add the three bobbing dots.

---

## 8. Sound mode stats bar (`SoundModeView.xaml`)

### 8.1 🟡 [SKIP] Missing dividers between stats
- **Design** (`.stats-bar .stat + .stat`): a 1 px left border divides Music | Device | Speed.
- **WPF** (`SoundModeView.xaml:291`): `UniformGrid` columns with no dividers.
- **Fix:** add vertical 1 px separators between the three stat columns.

### 8.2 🟢 Stats bar corner radius
- **Design**: `border-radius: 12px`.
- **WPF** (`SoundModeView.xaml:285`): `CornerRadius=8`.
- **Fix:** set to 12.

### 8.3 🟢 Stat value font size
- **Design** (`.stat .v`): 18 px.
- **WPF** (`SoundModeView.xaml:305` etc.): 17.
- **Fix:** bump to 18.

---

## 9. Sliders

### 9.1 🟡 [SKIP] No "muted/capped" slider variant in Sound mode
- **Design** (`.slider.muted`): when capped, the filled portion uses a muted `#D8C0C8` instead of rose.
- **WPF** (`SoundModeView.xaml:520-524`): max-speed slider always uses `ManualSpeedSlider` (rose fill),
  even when `IsCapped`.
- **Fix:** add a muted slider style and swap to it when capped.

---

## 10. Rhythm tiles (`SoundModeView.xaml`)

### 10.1 🟢 Active tile missing the focus-ring glow
- **Design** (`.rhythm-tile.active`): active tile gets `box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px rose-soft, 0 2px 10px
  rgba(196,118,138,0.18)` (a soft outer ring + lift).
- **WPF** (`SoundModeView.xaml:473-482`): active state sets border + background + colors but **no shadow
  ring/glow**.
- **Fix:** add an outer glow (e.g. a sibling shadow border) on the active tile.

---

## 11. Footer (`ConnectedView.xaml`)

### 11.1 🟢 Stop button missing drop shadow
- **Design** (`.btn.stop`): `box-shadow: 0 4px 14px rgba(0,0,0,0.28)` (and a sage-tinted shadow when
  flashed).
- **WPF** (`SharedStyles.xaml:117-183`): no drop shadow on the stop button.
- **Fix:** add a two-layer shadow under the stop button (per the WPF shadow rule).

---

## 12. Theming

### 12.1 ✅ Theme: Light/Dark/System selector + persistence — IMPLEMENTED
- The 3-way **Light / Dark / System** theme control now lives on the Settings screen, and the choice
  persists between sessions. **Done as part of §13.1 (part C):** `App.ApplyThemePreference` swaps the
  theme dictionary, `System` resolves via `UISettings` and follows the OS live through
  `ColorValuesChanged`, and `UserPreferences.Theme` is saved/loaded in `user-settings.json`.

### 12.2 🟢 Card shadow fidelity
- **Design** (`--shadow-card`): a layered shadow (`0 1px 2px …04`, `0 8px 28px …06`).
- **WPF**: single `DropShadowEffect` with `CardShadowOpacity=0.1`. Approximation only — revisit if cards
  look too heavy/light vs. the mock.

---

## 13. Settings screen & theme relocation (NEW in latest design)

### 13.1 ✅ Settings feature — IMPLEMENTED (consolidated)
> **Single tracked item.** This bundles the new Settings screen with the two changes that only make
> sense alongside it: the mode-bar gear button (was §6.3) and the relocation of theme switching into
> Settings (was §12.1). Ship them together. The connection-screen Settings gear (§5.6) is the same
> entry point and is best done in the same pass.
>
> **Done (all parts A/B/C + §5.6):** `UI/Views/SettingsView.xaml` (+ `SettingsViewModel`) is shown
> as an app-level overlay in `MainWindow.xaml` (visible on `MainViewModel.IsSettingsOpen`), covering
> both connection and connected content and the footer. The connected mode-bar's left slot is now a
> Settings gear (`ConnectedView.xaml`, `OpenSettingsCommand`); the connection screens have the
> top-right gear FAB (`ConnectionView.xaml`, hidden during Scanning/Connecting). Theme is a
> Light/Dark/System segmented control wired to `App.ApplyThemePreference` with live OS-follow for
> System (`UISettings.ColorValuesChanged`) and persisted in `user-settings.json` via
> `UserPreferences.Theme`. The data folder is user-editable (`Configuration/AppDataPaths.cs`, fixed
> `%LOCALAPPDATA%` pointer file + migrate-and-restart on change); "Open in Explorer" opens it.
> Version reads from the assembly (`<Version>0.1.0</Version>`).
>
> Minor design deviation: the segmented control's active-pill glow is omitted (a `DropShadowEffect`
> on a text-bearing element blurs the text — see the WPF shadow rule in CLAUDE.md).

**Part A — The Settings screen itself**
- **Design** (`settings.jsx` `SettingsScreen`, `index.html:956`): a full-window view that **replaces
  the mode content** while open (opened from the gear in the mode bar / connection FAB; the footer stop
  bar hides while it's shown). Structure:
  - **Header** (`.settings-head`) — a back-arrow `icon-btn` (34 px, 9 px radius) + "Settings" title
    (18 px, weight 600), with a 1 px bottom border.
  - **Appearance** (`.set-group` → `.set-card`) — a "Theme" row: title (`.rk`) + subtitle (`.rsub`
    "Follow the system setting or pick a fixed look.") on the left, the Light/Dark/System segmented
    control (`.seg`, rose active pill) on the right.
  - **Application data** — a stacked "Data folder" row: title + subtitle, a monospace path field
    (`.path-field` — folder icon + ellipsized path on `surface-soft`), then two actions: **"Change…"**
    (ghost `.btn.sm`) and **"Open in Explorer"** (subtle `.btn.sm`, external-link icon).
  - **About** — three rows: Version (`1.4.2`), Author (`SimonsSecrets`), Contact (mailto link in
    rose-dark).
  - **Support** (`.kofi-card`) — heading "Enjoying HismithController?", a blurb, and a full-width
    **"Support me on Ko-fi"** button (`#FF5E5B`, coffee icon, 46 px, 9 px radius).
- **WPF**: no Settings screen, `SettingsView`, or settings view-model exists.

**Part B — Entry points (was §6.3 + §5.6)**
- **Design**: the connected mode-bar's **left slot is a Settings gear** (`theme-toggle inline` pill,
  `settings` icon at 17 px); the connection screens get a top-right gear FAB (§5.6). Both open the
  Settings screen.
- **WPF** (`ConnectedView.xaml:79-130`): the left slot is still a sun/moon **theme toggle** that flips
  the theme in place; connection screens have no gear at all.

**Part C — Theme control moves into Settings (was §12.1)**
- **Design** (`ThemeSeg`, `index.html:84` dark palette + `.seg`): theme is chosen via the **Light /
  Dark / System** segmented control on the Settings screen; `System` follows the OS preference live.
- **WPF**: `DarkTheme.xaml` exists but `App.xaml` only merges `LightTheme.xaml`; no Light/Dark/System
  selector, no `System` (follow-OS) support, and the choice is not persisted between sessions.

**Fix (all parts):** build a `SettingsView` shown in place of the mode content; swap the mode-bar
theme toggle for a gear that opens it and add the connection-screen gear FAB; move theme selection into
the Settings segmented control (wire runtime `DarkTheme.xaml` swap, implement `System`, persist the
choice). Needs several **new vector icons** not yet in the WPF app: `arrowLeft`, `folder`, `external`,
`monitor`, `coffee` (the gear `settings` icon already exists in `connection.jsx` paths). The "Open in
Explorer" action and theme persistence both map to existing `OpenTasks.md` items.
